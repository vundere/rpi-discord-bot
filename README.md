# rpi-discord-bot

These are the working files for a discord bot I wrote.

Primarily as a learning experience, which means it's a bunch of bits pilfered 
from here and there held together by string and some leftover tape.  
Since it's a shitshow of a project, I haven't really paid much attention to licensing
when I've been looking at other people's code to figure out how this works.
So if there's a part in here that works and looks clean, that's probably not mine.

One day I might write a proper readme, not that anyone'll ever read it, but so I learn how.

Not really meant for anyone else to use, so right now there are no example settings or anything.
If you for whatever reason want to use this bot, it shouldn't be too hard to figure out.
